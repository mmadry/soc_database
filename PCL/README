SOC2PCLReaders loads the RGB-D Stereo Object Category (SOC) Database files in the SYNCPC and CRD format to the PCL. 
Please find attached:
* two example apps:
- 'read_syncpc' that loads a XYZ pointcloud in the SYNCPC format to the PCL and visualizes the loaded pointcloud
- 'read_crd' that loads a XYZRGB pointcloud and correspoding xy image coordinates (left stereo image) from the CRD format to the PCL, and visualizes the loaded pointcloud.
* a few SYNCPC and CRD test files in ./testdata

===
Build and compile:
$ mkdir build && cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make

Description of the SYNCPC and CRD formats

CRD format structure on the example of 'mammal01_filterSegment_000.crd' file

49423 							# total number of points in a 3D pointcloud
310.731624 532.125305 32.501743 386 134 162 95 33 	# one line for each 3D point contains:

* 310.731624 532.125305 32.501743 			# X, Y and Z coordinates of a point
* 386 134 						# x and y coordinates in a left stereo image [pixels];
* 162 95 33 						# R, G and B color of a point
