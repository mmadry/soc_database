RGB-D STEREO OBJECT CATEGORY (SOC) DATABASE SOFTWARE
=======================================================
Two packages 
./Matlab
./PCL
contain tools to load and process the RGB-D Stereo Object Category (SOC) (images and 3D point clouds) to Matlab and the Point Cloud Library (PCL). Detailed description of each package can be found in README files in the corresponding directories.

The database has been published in:
[1] Marianna Madry and Dan Song and Danica Kragic, "From object categories to grasp transfer using probabilistic reasoning". In IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), 2012 

The code was developed by Marianna Madry (marianna.madry@gmail.com) at the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH), Sweden.
